IBM 5110 Service Logic Manual Posters
and
IBM 5110 Display Symbols (standard and international)

The IBM 5110 was a portable personal computer system available in 1978.
It was an upgraded version of the IBM 5100 released in 1975.

The SLM (Service Logic Manual) is a set of large posters.  Each poster is
about 4x2 sheets of paper (8.5x11") size.  Digitizing these required a large
scanner and was done at 600 DPI resolution.   The SLM is not a component
level schematic, but is the logical (pin, signal, 0/1) relationship between
part on the system cards.   This includes also pin numbers, to guide
what aspects of the system are involved for the various sub-systems.


The repository also contains the Display symbol set available
on the IBM 5110.  The Display is configured to pick a particular
Default (via jumpers on the board), but this can be programmatically
adjusted (using the FLS file from BASIC, similar option in APL), or
pressing HOLD, then doing SHLFT 0-9.  The IBM 5110 BASIC Reference Manual
contains the set of symbols.
